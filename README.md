You will need to have Node.js to run this project. First, download all dependencies with npm install. The server can be run in the backend folder with "node server.js" and the web app can be run in the frontend folder with "npm run dev". The website is then visible at localhost:5000.

All SQL statements can be seen in the SQL folder.

After creating a database using the provided .sql files, you can change the database connection information in server.js. It is important to note that this app is configured to work with a MySQL database.
